# Color Palette Generator

The purpose of the color palette generator is to create a random color palette for a user and then display the resulting palette. The user will be able to specify the size of the color palette that they want (from 2 to 30 elements). A list of random hex values will be generated and displayed next to their corresponding colors. This will be written in JavaScript with the intention to be displayed in a web browser. There may be further extensions of the code that allow extra functionality.

# Version 1 

Description: Version 1 has the capability to create random color palettes of varying sizes.

Functionality:

- Slider: Has a slider that can accept user input as to how many different colors should be added into the palette. As the slider moves, the number to its left updates to show the current value of the slider. The slider can choose palettes of sizes from 2 to 30.
- Button: Has one button that gets rid of the current palette in the display area and creates a new one.
- Random palette: The generator can make color palettes, but only random ones. There is no capability to change the types of colors generated - only the number of colors generated can be changed.
- Responsive text color: The text that displays the name of the hex color is capable of changing based on the relative brightness of the color. When the color is darker, the text is white so that it shows up on the background. When the background is lighter, it will have black text. This is to avoid having text that is hard to read when displayed on the background.
