# Color Palette Generator

The purpose of the color palette generator is to create a random color palette for a user and then display the resulting palette. The user will be able to specify the size of the color palette that they want (from 2 to 30 elements). A list of random hex values will be generated and displayed next to their corresponding colors. This will be written in JavaScript with the intention to be displayed in a web browser. There may be further extensions of the code that allow extra functionality.
